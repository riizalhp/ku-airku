AirKu Project - A Simple Explanation
Welcome to the AirKu Project! Think of this as a digital "smart book" designed specifically to help drinking water delivery businesses. This document will explain what this project contains in easy-to-understand language, as if you've never touched a computer for technical matters.

What is "AirKu"?
Imagine you own a water refilling station business. Every day, you have to record orders, arrange delivery routes for couriers, check your gallon inventory, and ensure all customers are served well. It's a lot of work, right?

AirKu is an application system created to simplify all of that. Think of it as your digital personal assistant. This system has two main parts:

The Employee App (Frontend): This is the part your employees see and use on their phones or computers. Its interface is designed to be user-friendly, much like a social media app. Here, they can view schedules, record new orders, or report completed deliveries.
The System's Brain (Backend): This is the "engine room" that works behind the scenes. Its job is to receive commands from the employee app, save them, and organize everything neatly. When a new order comes in, this is the part that processes it.
All the data—like customer lists, the number of gallons sold, or delivery routes—is stored in a secure place we call a Database, just like a digital ledger or filing cabinet.

Key Features
The AirKu system has several main capabilities to help your business run smoothly:

👨‍💼 User Management: You can register all your employees (admins, sales staff, couriers) into the system and assign them different levels of access. An admin can see everything, while a courier can only see their delivery route for the day.
💧 Product Management: Keep a record of the products you sell, such as new gallons or water refills, along with their prices.
🛒 Order Management: Sales staff can enter customer orders directly through the app, so there's no more need for paper notes that can get lost.
🗺️ Smart Route Planning: This is the star feature. The system can automatically create the most efficient delivery route for each courier every day. No more couriers wasting time and fuel covering the same ground.
🚚 Vehicle & Fleet Management: You can register all the motorcycles or cars used for deliveries, making it easier to track and manage your fleet.
🏪 Store/Customer Management: All customer data, from addresses to order histories, is stored neatly. Sales staff can also add new potential customers (stores) to the system.
📊 Sales Reports: Want to know how many gallons were sold today or this week? The system can instantly generate easy-to-read reports.
How Does It Work? (A Super Simple Analogy)
To make it easier to visualize, let's use the analogy of a restaurant.

The App (Frontend) is the waiter who takes orders from customers.
The System's Brain (Backend) is the chef in the kitchen who receives the order from the waiter, prepares the food, and ensures all ingredients are in stock.
The Database is the pantry where all the ingredients and recipe books are stored.
When a salesperson enters a new order through the app (the waiter takes an order), that information is sent to the system's "brain" (the chef receives the order). The "brain" will then store it in the "database" (the chef gets ingredients from the pantry) and display it in the order management section so it can be prepared for delivery. Everything happens automatically and quickly!

Who is This Project For?
This project is a great fit for:

Water Depot Business Owners: To modernize their operations and make them more efficient.
Operational Managers: To easily monitor the performance of their sales and courier teams.
IT Staff or Developers: As a foundation for building more complex distribution management systems.
We hope this explanation helps you better understand the AirKu Project!
